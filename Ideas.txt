#Breakline - 2D - Sidescrolling - touchscreen
The player controls a car. The player can either accelerate by pressing the right half of the screen, or
decelerate by clicking the left side.

The aim of the game is to reach the end line before running out of fuel.

Accelerating naturally uses up fuel, the player has to use perfect timing to make it
through the obstacles in the stage to reach the end. 

The car follows a line which curves up and down. The car has to drive up the hill which slows it down
so the player has to have enough speed.
