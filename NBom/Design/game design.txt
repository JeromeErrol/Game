FUEL

Overview
----------------------------------------
The game is essentially and adventure/puzzle game. The player controls an avatar exploring different worlds
collecting treasures and fighting bad guys. The idea is that the player has to learn how to solve each puzzle 
as efficiently as possible. The main quest of the game is always to save on petrol, as the further through the game
the player is, the harder it is to find. If the player wastes petrol too much early on, then they cannot finish the game
and have to start again, each time, learning how to do it better and better. For example, some puzzles should only be
half completed because the other half requires an ability ta the player finds later in the game, then the player should
return to the puzzle when they get it.

Crystal Ball Rendering

and return later on when they have got the power required.

his burst attack from their side to kill them.

Awesome Boss battles
----------------------------------------
The boss battles are very creative in that the player has to figure out how to hurt the boss first

Graphics
----------------------------------------
Super Colorful! The game looks extremely beautiful. Things are drawn using extremely polished vector graphics. 
Every there are colors and the environment changes depending on the user. For example the flow 
bubbles color changes depending on which way the user is going.

Amazing Dynamic/Interactive Soundtrack
----------------------------------------
The soundtrack is effected by events in the game. For example if the player boosts, a distortion effect is 
added to the soundtrack combined with a slowing down of the tempo. Each level has a different song.

Environment
----------------------------------------
Flow Bubbles: Flow bubbles flow in a certain direction. If the user is travelling in the same direction as a flow
bubble it will boost the player, if the player its it from the opposite direction they will slow and stop the player.
The bubble's color changes color depending on the difference between its direction and the players. If the player is
travellingi the same direction the bubbles are rendered green. Perpendicular they are rendered yellow and opposite
they are colored red. This way the user can figure out which way the are facing.

Burst Attack
----------------------------------------
Directly after a strong burst the ship becomes very hard and can penetrate enemies. This is the ships 
primary attack. If the ship isn't moving or is only moving very slowly the enemies can attack the player.
