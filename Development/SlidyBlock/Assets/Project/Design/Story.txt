<Introduction>
This is the story of a brave and galant knight...
[Square appears]
Erm yes, well this knight carried a heavy burden, a secret about which he felt mightily embarrassed. 
The Knight... had never been on a heroiric quest before!
Eventually the day came that the knight could no longer bear his shame and decided to venture out from the safety 
of the castle on the search for a mighty quest! And that day happened to be today!
There was only one problem. The knight's father was the king who would probably dissaprove of the knight's leaving and
thus the knight had to sneak out of the castle without being caught.

With a determined heart the knight peaped out into the hallway. A guard was pacing backwards and forwards. 
The knight being rather clever, waited until just the right moment then as quietly as a mouse, 
snuck passed without being noticed.

Adrenaline rushing, heart pumping the knight tip toed down the spiral staircase. At the bottom, 
two more guards patrolled. 

<Hint>
Initially the knight gave up hope of ever passing the guards and felt very sad however
after observing the guards for a little while, realised that once in a while the guards would swap sides. Perhaps, he could sneak
in between them during this moment.

Yahey, made it! 

The knight knew that the castle was defended by more than just guards. An assortment of booby traps had been
set up in the case that thief managed to sneak past.
